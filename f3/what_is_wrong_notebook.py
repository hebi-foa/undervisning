# This file simulates a Jupyter notebook with data analysis code that needs fixing
# Each section represents a cell in the notebook

# Cell 1: Data Loading and Initial Processing
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load data (missing error handling and file existence check)
data = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')
sales = data['sales']
dates = data['date']

# Cell 2: Data Cleaning (inefficient and problematic)
# Remove missing values
clean_data = []
for i in range(len(sales)):
    if sales[i] > 0:  # Doesn't handle NaN properly
        clean_data.append(sales[i])

# Convert to numpy array (unnecessary conversion back and forth)
sales_array = np.array(clean_data)
sales_list = list(sales_array)

# Cell 3: Statistical Analysis (multiple issues)
# Calculate basic statistics
mean_sales = sum(sales_list) / len(sales_list)
total_sales = sum(sales_list)

# Calculate variance (repeating calculations)
squared_diff = 0
for sale in sales_list:
    diff = sale - mean_sales
    squared_diff += diff * diff
variance = squared_diff / len(sales_list)

# Cell 4: Visualization (poor practices)
# Create sales trend plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(range(len(clean_data)), clean_data)  # Using index instead of dates
plt.title('Sales Trend')
plt.show()  # Missing labels and proper date formatting

# Cell 5: Sales Prediction (problematic implementation)
def predict_next_month_sales(historical_sales):
    # Overly simplistic prediction
    last_three_months = historical_sales[-3:]
    prediction = sum(last_three_months) / 3
    return prediction  # No confidence interval or validation

# Make prediction
next_month = predict_next_month_sales(clean_data)
print(f"Predicted sales for next month: {next_month}")

# Cell 6: Export Results (unsafe file operations)
# Save results to file
with open('sales_prediction.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"Average Sales: {mean_sales}\n")
    f.write(f"Total Sales: {total_sales}\n")
    f.write(f"Predicted Next Month: {next_month}\n")

# Common issues to fix:
# 1. No proper error handling
# 2. Inefficient data conversions
# 3. Poor visualization practices
# 4. Missing data validation
# 5. Repetitive calculations
# 6. No type hints
# 7. Unsafe file operations
# 8. Poor documentation
# 9. No logging
# 10. Missing unit tests
